# Unofficial SF Symbols Game

Unofficial SF Symbols Game is simple game to help you get familar with the names of the amazing SF Symbols by Apple.

I find the naming of the symbols hard, though. It all started from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1238116376491053058?s=20) by Thomas. 

During that time, the college closed due to lockdown. This seemed to be the perfect side project to work on!

I haven't been able to work on it for months, but I want to pick it up again. 

I don't have a roadmap as such, but here are some of the ideas that I can think out loud - 

- [ ] Grid layout for all the symbols to create a viewer app as well.
- [ ] Take inspiration from other hypercasual games on the store. 
- [ ] Settings screen. 
- [ ] History screen.
- [ ] Game Center support.
- [ ] Three game modes - Chill, Timed, Aggressive. 
- [ ] Chill - Current version where you play to learn new symbols.
- [ ] Aggressive - Earn points on the correct answer, and lose for the wrong one.
- [ ] Timed - Select as many correct answers in a given time.
